This is my first project using C++. The focus of making this was to understand the basics of this language.

Learning Highlights:

Basic Input/Output: 
The program effectively demonstrates how to use cin to get user input (name, age, current year, future year)
and cout to display information to the console. This is fundamental to most interactive programs.

Variables: 
The code utilizes variables (name, age, year, future) to store and manipulate data, which is a core concept
in programming.

Data Types: 
It showcases the use of different data types: string for names and int for ages and years.

Conditional Statements: 
The if statement and the while loop introduce the concept of conditional execution, allowing the program to
make decisions and repeat actions based on user input.

String Comparison: The code compares the user's input ("Yay" or "Ney") to determine whether to continue or 
exit the loop. This demonstrates basic string manipulation.
